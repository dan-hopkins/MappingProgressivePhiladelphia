Our members are involved in helping to build a number of struggles: the movement to stop war and occupation, fights against racism and anti-immigrant scapegoating, the struggle for women''s rights like the right to choose abortion, opposing anti-gay bigotry, and standing up for workers'' rights. The misery that millions of people around the world face is rooted in the society we live in--capitalism, where the few who rule profit from the labor of the vast majority of the population. In the U.S., a tiny proportion of the population enjoys fantastic wealth, while millions of people live in desperate poverty, and many more live paycheck to paycheck. Yet we have the resources to feed, clothe and educate everyone on the planet. A world free of exploitation--socialism--is not only possible but worth fighting for. The ISO stands in the tradition of revolutionary socialists Karl Marx, V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky in the belief that workers themselves--the vast majority of the population--are the only force that can lead the fight to win a socialist society. Socialism can''t be brought about from above, but has to be won by workers themselves. The Democratic Party, much like the Republicans, acts in the interests of Corporate America and the privileged few at the top. Therefore, we do not support their candidates. We see our task as building an independent socialist organization with members organizing in our workplaces, our schools and our neighborhoods to bring socialist ideas to the struggles we are involved in today, and the vision of a socialist world in the future.','');

For us, the terms âmediaâ, âqueerâ, âtrans*â, and âsocial changeâ are big tents: we support art that thinks creatively and radically about what these can mean and where they intertwine.

We organize the annual MEDIA ACTIVISM SERIES that takes place each Spring. The series showcases work by media artists at the crossroads of queer political activism and queer media production, particularly work that foregrounds the intersections of race, class, disability, citizenship, sexuality, and gender identity/expression. Its goal is not just to increase the exposure and accessibility of queer and trans* media makers, but also to build community and foster conversations around oppression and activism.','@philqueermedia');
